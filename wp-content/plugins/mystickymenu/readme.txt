You can also use this sticky menu plugin will make your menu or header sticky on top of page, after desired number of pixels when scrolled.

By default, myStickymenu should make your menu sticky without any adjustments on your end - which means your menu should become sticky right out of the box. Sticky menu is designed to use element class ".navbar" as "Sticky Class". That value should be modified in plugin settings for different themes to make it work. Sticky Class is actually nothing more than an element class (or id) of the element that should become sticky.

> "Works great.
One of the key elements that I consider when choosing a theme is the sticky menu option. If the theme doesn't have it normally I don't use it. But now that’s not a problem for me anymore."<br><br>


> "This plugin rocks!
This plugin does exactly what it should. It is simple but powerful. I would suggest to anyone who wants to make their navigation menu sticky! I especially love the hide header on scroll down, show on scroll up feature that is built it. Great work!<br>




== Installation ==
After you activate the plugin, you should be able to create your first notification bar with ease, just customize the appearance and save it. If you want to create a sticky menu, in most cases the plugin should be able to find the class/ID for the menu, if not then change sticky class/id to .your_navbar_class or #your_navbar_id - you might need to purge the cache after saving.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How to find Sticky Class, what should I enter here? =
So this depends on what you want to make sticky and what theme do you use, but for example, if you want your menu to be sticky, then you can examine the code (in firefox right click and “View page source”) and find HTML element in which your menu is situated. This element has some class or id, and that’s the Sticky Class we need. If using class then don’t forget to ad dot (.) in front of the class name or hash (#) in front of id. Twenty Thirteen default working class is ".navbar" without of quotes.


= Is there any way to restrict the width to the width of the header, rather than it being full width? =
Yes, just leave the "Sticky Background Color" field blank (clear). Then if needed define a custom background color for a sticky header inside ".myfixed CSS class" field using .myfixed class. 


= Ho do I add a small logo to the menu? =
That will depend on a theme you use, but if initially your menu and logo are in one div then you can use that div class or id in myStickymenu settings. 


If not you can change that in your header template file and add logo and menu divs inside new div with some custom class or id, then use that class or id in myStickymenu settings as a sticky class.


In CSS you can style your custom class while not sticky using the custom class you added before. Furthermore, you can style your menu while sticky using .myfixed class which is added by js to your custom class while sticky is active. 


In some cases, you can use the whole header div and then just style it differently with .myfixed class, hide what you don’t need to use CSS display:none; property, and position logo and menu as you like. 


= Is there a time limit for the free plan? =
No. you can use the free plan as long as you want.
